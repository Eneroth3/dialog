      The dialog style module is based on the Extension Manager look and feel,
      with some adjustments.
      This module is intended to unify the user experience between SketchUp
      extension, and between extensions and native features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Style elements as buttons by adding the class <code>dlg-button</code>.
    </p>
    <button class="dlg-button" onclick="alert('Clicked Foo');">Foo</button>
    <button class="dlg-button" onclick="alert('Clicked Bar');">Bar</button>
    <p>
      Add the class <code>dlg-button-call-to-action</code> for a call to action
      button, styled in stylish SketchUp red.
      Typically there is only one call to action button at time in a dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using the controls module, the call to action button typically also
      is the default action, denoted by the <code>dlg-default-action</code>
      class.
    </p>
    <button class="dlg-button dlg-button-call-to-action" onclick="alert('Clicked Foo');">Foo</button>
    <button class="dlg-button" onclick="alert('Clicked Bar');">Bar</button>
    <p>
      The focused button is outlined in Trimble blue
      (YAY, Trimble also got to have its color in this otherwise very SketchUppy color scheme).
      This allows the user to see use the tab key to cycle through the commands.
      This is functionality that is unfortunately too often omitted when design
      only means appearance.
    </p>
    <button class="dlg-button dlg-button-call-to-action" autofocus onclick="alert('Clicked Foo');">Foo</button>
    <button class="dlg-button" onclick="alert('Clicked Bar');">Bar</button>
    <!-- TODO show full dialog (in seemingly floating div with shadow, and stylized window chrome -->
  </body>
